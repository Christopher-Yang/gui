This is a GUI to plot simulated tracking data as phasors in the frequency domain. To run the GUI, place all files into the same repository and run phasor_gui.m.

This will plot the phasors for X and Y movements in all pairwise permutations. Motor execution noise and the feedback gain matrix (L) can be adjusted in the GUI. Click "Push to replot phasors" to update the phasor plots.
